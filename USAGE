USAGE:
    fswap { help | begin | end | info | revert | swap } [OPTIONS...] [ARGUMENTS...]

NOTES:

    this tool was made 4fun, backup your things !

    must be in FSWAP DIR for all commands that do not take it as an argument
        (this might change in the future)


COMMANDS

    begin [SOURCE DIR] [FSWAP DIR]
        Creates .fswap file linking SOURCE_DIR and FSWAP DIR.

    end [FSWAP DIR]
        Deletes .fswap file, and ALL swapped files. Does not revert changes before doing so.

    info [FSWAP DIR]
        Prints all swapped files.

    revert [FILES...]
        Reverts a swapped file to it's original state (e.g. file.fswap -> file).

    swap [FILES...]
        If they both exist, swaps a file from SOURCE DIR to FSWAP DIR, and saves the swapped file.


OPTIONS

    -a, --all => { revert | swap }
        Default: false
        This option does COMMAND to all files in the fswap directory, recursively

    -h, --help
        Default: false
        This option prints a simplified help message.

    -n, --noconfirm => { end }
        Default: false
        This option causes end to not ask the user for confirmation before deleting all fswap files.

    -r, --recursive => { revert | swap }
        Default: false
        This option does COMMAND to all files in the given directory (interprets files passed as arguments as directories).

    -s, --silent
        Default: false
        Suppresses output of this program.
